# Design System Project Rules

## Project Context
This is a learning project to build a sophisticated design system inspired by GitHub's Primer.
Duration: 28 weeks across 12 phases.
Current Phase: Phase 1 Complete ✅ | Phase 2 Next ⏳

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- React 18+ (with hooks)
- Styled Components + CSS Variables
- Vite (build tool)
- pnpm (package manager)
- Vitest + React Testing Library (testing)
- Storybook (documentation)

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use forwardRef for components that need ref access
- Export components with displayName set
- Write comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Use semantic HTML
- Follow accessibility best practices (WCAG 2.1 AA)

## Component Guidelines
- All components must be accessible
- Include ARIA attributes where needed
- Support keyboard navigation
- Test with screen readers
- Provide TypeScript types for all props
- Write Storybook stories for each component
- Write unit tests (80%+ coverage goal)

## File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., Button.tsx)
- Utilities: camelCase (e.g., styleProps.ts)
- Tests: *.test.tsx
- Stories: *.stories.tsx
- Types: *.types.ts

## Documentation
- Update PROGRESS.md when completing tasks
- Document learnings and reflections
- Write clear commit messages
- Keep README updated

## Quality Standards
- 80%+ test coverage
- Zero critical accessibility issues
- Lighthouse score 95+
- Bundle size < 200KB
- All TypeScript strict checks passing
